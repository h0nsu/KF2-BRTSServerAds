[h1]Support and Collaboration[/h1]
If you find any issues or have requests open a new GitHub issue. If you need support please refer to the official thread. I will try to keep this item up to date but I have to do it manually (I do not have a build pipeline for this). So if you see a new version on GitHub that isn't here in the Steam Workshop yet, just let me know and I will update it. If you are interested on helping to maintain this item let me know. If you want to improve the code feel free to fork it on GitHub and make pull requests.
